        <h3 class="section">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Canadian bacon</li>
            <li>English muffin</li>
            <li>American cheese</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
    <h3 class="section">Equipment</h3>
        <ul></ul>
            <li>Non-stick frying pan</li>
            <li>Rubber or nylon spatula</li>
            <li>Small bowl</li>
            <li>Whisk or a fork for whipping the eggs</li>
            <li>Hot Sauce (optional)</li>
    <h3 class="section">Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat your non-stick pan over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Separate and toast your English muffin halves in the toaster. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Once the pan is hot enough, place your Canadian bacon in the pan. Cook to individual preference and set aside. Turn pan to medium heat.</li>
            <li>Crack one egg per sandwich into a small bowl. Add 1 tbsp of milk per egg into the same bowl.</li>
            <li>Using a whisk or fork, whip the eggs and milk together until fully homogenous and bubbles have formed around the sides of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Place 1 tbsp of butter per sandwich in the pan and spread throughout.</li>
            <li>Pour whipped eggs into the pan and let sit for 10-15 seconds to set.</li>
            <li>Using your spatula, pull 4 corners of the edges of the eggs into the center, allowing the liquid eggs to fill in the gaps this motion creates.</li>
            <li>Allow eggs to sit for 10-15 more seconds and repeat the pulling of the edges of the eggs into the center; again allowing the remaining liquid eggs to fill the gaps.</li>
            <li>Once most of the eggs are set, divide eggs in the pan up by as many sandwiches as you are creating. <strong>EX:</strong> If you are making 2 sandwiches, you will draw a line down the middle. If you are making 4, you will divide them in quadrants.</li>
            <li>Using your spatula, fold the eggs in on themselves to from a square that is slightly larger than the English muffin itself. Flip the egg patty, turn off the heat on the pan and let sit while you prepare the English muffins to receive the eggs.</li>
            <li>Place one slice of American cheese on the bottom portion of the toasted English muffin.</li>
            <li>Using the spatula, place one egg patty on top of the cheese and season to with salt, pepper and your choice of hot sauce.</li>
            <li>Place the once slice of Canadian bacon on top of the seasoned egg patty.</li>
            <li>Place the top of the English muffin on top of the Canadian bacon.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately and enjoy with your favorite cup of coffee, or juice!</li>
